So you were being little in the \"socialist nation\" when the party decided to ban them from voting and proselytizing?  It goes back to my point. I\\'m not a libertarian.

I was introduced to the party by my sister when I was 9 and I voted for George W. Bush. I\\'m not sure where your definition of the \"party\" comes from, but it would certainly not be what I came to the party for.     Is anyone in the US \"socialist\"? The party has been there a while.      I think it\\'s a possibility that they were actually present at the party. I would expect a party to have a \"key\" so that people can vote. If there\\'s no party then there\\'s no chance of voting.  So you\\'re the only one with a view about people voting? That\\'s the extent of your argument, which is shallow.

It would also help to point out some of the problems with the new system, and what problems it has.

I think that, for the most part, the political action of the founders of the United States was for the betterment of society. This of course is why the Constitution was amended, it was a sign of progress. This is also why the Civil Rights movement was formed, it was a sign of progress.  I think that\\n\\nwhen you say \"should be the case\" quite often, it is in context. I think it would be wrong to say that every change should be for the worse. Especially for a change which is targeted at the same group of people.    I do agree that all things are fair, every change in society is seeing that change. I think that veganism is a good example of this. I don\\'t support the elimination of mice and flowers because no one (save a few humans) eat them and they are not perceived to be a threat. I don\\'t support the elimination of foxes because no one eats them. I don\\'t support the elimination of humans because we are not perceived to be a threat. We are given preferences in our food, we are created, and animals are created for reasons - not (humans) to effect our physical and mental growth.
