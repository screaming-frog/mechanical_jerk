However, when it comes to increasing the rights of the people, I'm not so sure about just making the definition state - the majority of rights are not conferred to the majority, but rather to the people and I don't see why we should be limiting things to what is bad or not.

I don't think that would be a good thing.  And you can't argue with my facts, because I don't believe it. My point is THAT BATFE is able to trace guns for as long as they can be traced.

This climactic battle is why the struggle is so important, and this is why God uses it as a sign of His covenant.     I am not claiming that he is a \\'father\\' or anything of the sort.
